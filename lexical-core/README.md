# Features

- `algorithm_m` Use Algorithm M rather than bigcomp for the string-to-float parser. Algorithm M is ~4x faster than bigcomp, however, it may use significantly more memory. If and only if Algorithm M and radix are both active, lexical-core requires a system allocator.
- `radix` For lexical conversions to and from non-base10 representations.
- `ryu` Use dtolnay's [ryu](https://github.com/dtolnay/ryu/) library for fast and accurate float-to-string conversions.

# Documentation

Lexical-core's documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lexical-core).

# Validation

Float parsing is difficult to do correctly, and major bugs have been found in implementations from [libstdc++'s strtod](https://www.exploringbinary.com/glibc-strtod-incorrectly-converts-2-to-the-negative-1075/) to [Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue7632). In order to validate the accuracy of the lexical, we employ the following external tests:

1. Hrvoje Abraham's [strtod](https://github.com/ahrvoje/numerics/tree/master/strtod) test cases.
2. Rust's [test-float-parse](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/64185f205dcbd8db255ad6674e43c63423f2369a/src/etc/test-float-parse) unittests.
3. Testbase's [stress tests](https://www.icir.org/vern/papers/testbase-report.pdf) for converting from decimal to binary.
4. [Various](https://www.exploringbinary.com/glibc-strtod-incorrectly-converts-2-to-the-negative-1075/) [difficult](https://www.exploringbinary.com/how-glibc-strtod-works/) [cases](https://www.exploringbinary.com/how-strtod-works-and-sometimes-doesnt/) reported on blogs.

Although Lexical may contain bugs leading to rounding error, it is tested against a comprehensive suite of random-data and near-halfway representations, and should be fast and correct for the vast majority of use-cases.

# Caveats

Lexical uses unsafe code in the back-end for performance, and therefore may introduce memory-safety issues. Although the code is tested with wide variety of inputs to minimize the risk of memory-safety bugs, and then unittests are run are under Valgrind, no guarantees are made and you should use it at your own risk.

Finally, for non-decimal (base 10) floats, lexical's float-to-string implementation is lossy, resulting in rounding for a small subset of inputs (up to 0.1% of the total value).

## String to Float

For float parsing, lexical tries the following algorithms, using the first algorithm that produces a correct result:

1. **Fast Path** Create an exact representation using a native floating-point type from the significant digits and exponent.
2. **Moderate Path** Create an approximate representation, exact within rounding error, using a custom floating-point type with 80-bits of precision, preventing rounding-error in the significant digits.
3. **Fallback Moderate Path** Create an approximate 128-bit representation of the numerator and denominator for the halfway point between two potentially valid representations, to determine which representation is correct by comparing the actual digits to theoretical digits generated from the halfway point. This is accurate for ~36 digits with decimal float strings.
4. **Slow Path** Use arbitrary-precision arithmetic to disambiguate the correct representation.
    - **Default** Create an exact representation of the numerator and denominator for the halfway point between both representation, using arbitrary-precision integers, and determine which representation is accurate by comparing the actual digits to the theoretical digits. This is accurate for any number of digits, and the required amount of memory does not depend on the number of digits.
    - **Algorithm M** Create an exact representation of the digits as a big integer, to generate the significant digits (mantissa). If there is a fraction or a negative exponent, create a big ratio of both the numerator and the denominator, and generate the significant digits from the exact quotient and remainder.

Although using the 4<sup>th</sup> algorithm only occurs when a float is indistinguishable from a halfway representation (between two neighboring floating-point representations) to within 36 digits, maliciously constructed input could force use of the 4<sup>th</sup> algorithm. This has seriously implications for performance, since arbitrary-precision arithmetic scales poorly with large numbers, and can lead to performance degradation in excess of 100-50,000 fold. The lossy parser therefore avoids using arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and returns the result from the 2<sup>nd</sup> step, creating a native float accurate to within 1 bit in the mantissa, without major performance regressions.

To use Algorithm M, use the feature `algorithm_m` when compiling lexical.

## Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic

Lexical uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic to exactly represent strings between two floating-point representations with more than 36 digits, with various optimizations for multiplication and division relative to Rust's current implementation. The arbitrary-precision arithmetic logic is not independent on memory allocation: the default slow-path algorithm only uses the stack, while Algorithm M uses the heap.

## Comparison to Algorithm M

For close-to-halfway representations of a decimal string `s`, where `s` is close between two representations, `b` and the next float `b+u`, arbitrary-precision arithmetic is used to determine the correct representation. This means `s` is close to `b+h`, where `h` is the halfway point between `b` and `b+u`.

For the following example, we will use the following values for our test case: 

* `s = 2.4703282292062327208828439643411068618252990130716238221279284125033775363510437593264991818081799618989828234772285886546332835517796989819938739800539093906315035659515570226392290858392449105184435931802849936536152500319370457678249219365623669863658480757001585769269903706311928279558551332927834338409351978015531246597263579574622766465272827220056374006485499977096599470454020828166226237857393450736339007967761930577506740176324673600968951340535537458516661134223766678604162159680461914467291840300530057530849048765391711386591646239524912623653881879636239373280423891018672348497668235089863388587925628302755995657524455507255189313690836254779186948667994968324049705821028513185451396213837722826145437693412532098591327667236328125001e-324`
* `b = 0.0`
* `b+h = 2.4703282292062327208828439643411068618252990130716238221279284125033775363510437593264991818081799618989828234772285886546332835517796989819938739800539093906315035659515570226392290858392449105184435931802849936536152500319370457678249219365623669863658480757001585769269903706311928279558551332927834338409351978015531246597263579574622766465272827220056374006485499977096599470454020828166226237857393450736339007967761930577506740176324673600968951340535537458516661134223766678604162159680461914467291840300530057530849048765391711386591646239524912623653881879636239373280423891018672348497668235089863388587925628302755995657524455507255189313690836254779186948667994968324049705821028513185451396213837722826145437693412532098591327667236328125e-324`
* `b+u = 5e-324`

**Algorithm M**

Algorithm M is described [here](https://www.exploringbinary.com/correct-decimal-to-floating-point-using-big-integers/) in depth, and Rust's libcore uses it internally. First, Algorithm M converts both the fraction and the exponent to a fraction of big integers. For example, `3.14159e2` is the same as `314159e-3`, which means a numerator of `314159` and denominator of `1000`. Next, Algorithm M calculates the quotient and remainder of the numerator and denominator until the quotient is the same representation as the mantissa in the native float, for example, in range range `[2^52, 2^53)` for f64, or in the range `[2^23, 2^24)` for f32. If the quotient is below the range, multiply the numerator by 2, and decrease the binary exponent.  If the quotient is above the range, multiply the denominator by 2, and increase the binary exponent.

A naive implementation, in Python, is as follows:

```python
def algorithm_m(num, b):
    # Ensure numerator >= 2**52
    bits = int(math.ceil(math.log2(num)))
    if bits <= 53:
        num <<= 53
        b -= 53

    # Track number of steps required (optional).
    steps = 0
    while True:
        steps += 1
        c = num//b
        if c < 2**52:
            b //= 2
        elif c >= 2**53:
            b *= 2
        else:
            break

    return (num, b, steps-1)
```

For example, to scale `s` into the range `[2^52, 2^53)`, we would need a a numerator of `247....`, and a denominator of `10^1078`, requiring 1127 iterations to scale the value. Similarly, scaling `2.4703282292062327e-324` requires 1127 iterations to scale, each in `O(N^2)` time. 

Luckily, Rust uses a simple optimization: a quick estimate of the bitshift required to generate the correct ratio is calculated from the number of bits in the numerator and denominator. Although this optimization  Rust's libcore also uses a [slow division algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm#Restoring_division), and a slow exponentiation algorithm, scaling poorly for most inputs. 

Lexical's `algorithm_m` feature uses various optimizations to dramatically improve the approach.

1. It requires only 1-2 iterations to scale a value so the resulting quotient is in the range `[2^52, 2^53)`. It does this by multiplying the numerator to be 52-bits larger than the denominator on the first iteration, resulting in a quotient of 52 or 53 bits. If the quotient is 52-bits, multiply the numerator by 2 and repeat.
2. It uses basecase division (an implementation of Knuth's Algorithm D), which is an `O(q*m)` algorithm, requiring only `q` native divisions and `q*m` multiplications and subtractions, where `m` is the number of limbs in the divisor, and `n` is the number of limbs of the numerator, and `q = n - m`. Since we set the numerator to be 52 or 53 bits larger than the denominator, this means `q <= 3`, and therefore the algorithm is `O(m)`. In comparison, restoring division, used by libcore, is `O(n^2)`, and iterates over each bit in the numerator. To put this into perspective, for a numerator/denominator pair with ~2100 bits (1e307), restoring division requires ~140,000 native subtractions and comparisons, compared to ~96 multiplications and subtractions in lexical.
3. It limits the number of parsed digits used when representing the mantissa. Any decimal string for a binary float has a finite representation, after which, only the presence or absence of non-zero digits may affect the mantissa. By removing these trailing digits from the mantissa and only comparing them to '0', lexical provides an upper-bound on the computational cost in representing the significant digits of a float via an arbitrary-precision integer.

**bigcomp**

David M. Gay's `bigcomp` implementation in `dtoa` is the canonical string-to-float parser, and uses another approach for performance, described in depth [here](https://www.exploringbinary.com/bigcomp-deciding-truncated-near-halfway-conversions/). Bigcomp represents `b` as an N-bit integer (24 for f32, 53 for f64) and a binary exponent and calculates `b+h` from `b`. Finally, bigcomp scales `b+h` by a power of 10 such that the calculated value would be from [0, 10), and creates a fraction of big integers. It then calculates the generated digits from `b+h` by iteratively using calculating the quotient (the digit) and remainder of the fraction, setting the numerator to `10*remainder`. Each iteration requires ~1 division operation and `N` multiplication, addition and subtraction operations operations.

When the digits present in `s` or `b+h` differ from each other, the correct representation is determined. Therefore, bigcomp requires `N` division operations and `N^2` multiplication operations, where `N` is the number of native ints in the big integer. Furthermore, since the number of digits in the input string does not affect the size of the numerator/denominator in bigcomp (but does in algorithm M), bigcomp uses less memory in edge cases and has a lower-order `N` for complex inputs. Finally, all halfway representations stop producing digits after 767 digits, requiring only a simple comparison to categorize larger strings. 

**Conclusion**

In practice, this means for a 750 digit input string with a value near 5e-324, theoretically, algorithm M would perform ~250 times as many division/multiplication operations as bigcomp; for a 15,000 digit input string, nearly 100,000 times as many operations. In the worst scenario, for a 1MB string, on x86-64 hardware with a 2.20 GHz CPU, using a correct float parser based off algorithm M could take nearly 6 minutes of computation time, while only 50 Î¼s with bigcomp. Luckily, Rust does not implement a correct parser, avoiding denial-of-service attacks based off float parsing, however, it does so at the expense of correctness. Bigcomp both is more correct and more performant in all non-trivial cases, and the optimizations for trivial cases make lexical competitive with other float parsers for any input string.
