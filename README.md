[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/lexical.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/lexical)

Fast lexical conversion routines for both std and no_std environments. Lexical provides routines to convert numbers to and from decimal strings. Lexical also supports non-base 10 numbers, for both integers and floats. Lexical is simple to use, focuses on performance and correctness, and exports only 10 functions in the high-level API.

# Getting Started

Add lexical to your `Cargo.toml`:

```yaml
[dependencies]
lexical = "1"
```

And get started using lexical:

```rust
extern crate lexical;

// Number to string
lexical::to_string(3.0);            // "3.0", always has a fraction suffix, 
lexical::to_string(3);              // "3"
lexical::to_string_radix(3.0, 2);   // "11.0", non-base 10 representation.
lexical::to_string_radix(1.5, 2);   // "1.1"
lexical::to_string_radix(1.25, 2);  // "1.01"

// String to number.
let i: i32 = lexical::parse("3");            // 3, auto-type deduction.
let f: f32 = lexical::parse("3.5");          // 3.5
let d = lexical::parse::<f64, _>("3.5");     // 3.5, explicit type hints.
let d = lexical::try_parse::<f64, _>("3.5"); // Ok(3.5), error checking parse.
let d = lexical::try_parse::<f64, _>("3a");  // Err(Error(_)), failed to parse.
```

Lexical's parsers can be either error-checked and unchecked. The unchecked parsers continue to parse until they encounter invalid data or overflow, returning a number was successfully parsed up until that point. This is analogous to C's `strtod`, which may not be desirable for many applications. Therefore, lexical also includes checked parsers, which ensure the entire buffer is used while parsing, without discarding characters, and that the resulting number did not overflow. Upon erroring, the checked parsers will return the an enum indicating overflow or the index where the first invalid digit  was found.

```rust
// This will return Err(Error(ErrorKind::InvalidDigit(3))), indicating 
// the first invalid character occurred at the index 3 in the input 
// string (the space character).
let x: i32 = lexical::try_parse("123 456");

// This will return Ok(123), since that is the value found before invalid
// character was encountered.
let x: i32 = lexical::parse("123 456");
```

For floating-points, Lexical also includes `parse_lossy` and `try_parse_lossy`, which may lead to minor rounding error (relative error of ~1e-16) in rare cases (see [details](#details) for more information), without using slow algorithms that lead to serious performance degradation.

```rust
let x: f32 = lexical::parse_lossy("3.5");       // 3.5
let x: f32 = lexical::try_parse_lossy("3.5");   // Ok(3.5)
```

# Benchmarks

The following benchmarks measure the time it takes to convert 10,000 random values, for different types. The values were randomly generated using NumPy, and run in both std (rustc 1.29.2) and no_std (rustc 1.31.0) contexts (only std is shown) on an x86-64 Intel processor. More information on these benchmarks can be found in the [benches](benches) folder and in the source code for the respective algorithms. Adding the flags "target-cpu=native" and "link-args=-s" were also used, however, they minimally affected the relative performance difference between different lexical conversion implementations.

For cross-language benchmarks, the C++ benchmark was done using GCC 8.2.1 with libstdc++ using Google Benchmark and the `-O3` flag. The Python benchmark was done using IPython on Python 3.6.6. The Go benchmark was done using go1.10.4. All benchmarks used the same data.

For all the following benchmarks, lower is better.

# Backends

For Float-To-String conversions, lexical uses one of three backends: an internal, Grisu2 algorithm, an external, Grisu3 algorithm, and an external, Ryu algorithm (~2x as fast).

# Documentation

Lexical's documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/lexical).

# Caveats

Lexical heavily uses unsafe code for performance, and therefore may introduce memory-safety issues. Although the code is tested with wide variety of inputs to minimize the risk of memory-safety bugs, no guarantees are made and you should use it at your own risk.

Finally, for non-base10 floats, lexical's float-to-string implementations may lead to fairly lossy rounding for a small subset of inputs (up to 0.1% of the total value).

# Details

For more information on the Grisu2 and Grisu3 algorithms, see [Printing Floating-Point Numbers Quickly and Accurately with Integers](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/florian-loitsch/printf.pdf).

For more information on the Ryu algorithm, see [RyÅ«: fast float-to-string conversion](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3192369).

For float parsing, lexical uses a stepwise algorithm, using the first algorithm that produces a correct result:

1. Create an exact representation using a native floating-point type from the significant digits and exponent.
2. Create an approximate representation, exact within rounding error, using a custom floating-point type with 80-bits of precision, preventing rounding-error in the significant digits.
3. Create an exact representation of the significant digits using arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and create the closest native float from this representation.

Although using the 3rd algorithm only occurs when the estimated rounding error is greater than the difference between two floating-point representations (occurring in only extremely rare cases), maliciously constructed input could force use of the 3rd algorithm. This has seriously implications for performance, since arbitrary-precision arithmetic is extremely slow, and scales poorly for large numbers, and can lead to performance degradation of >100-1000x. The lossy float-parsing algorithms therefore avoid using arbitrary-precision arithmetic, and use a modified 2nd step using an extended floating-point type with 160-bits of precision, creating an accurate native float without major performance regressions in all but the most extenuating circumstances.

For example, a carefully-constructed 1MB string representing an array of floats could force ~10 seconds of CPU usage with a correct algorithm, as opposed to ~6.7ms with a lossy algorithm on a 2.20GHz machine.
