//! Fast and compact string-to-float conversions.
//!
//! # Note
//!
//! Only documented functionality is considered part of the public API:
//! any of the modules, internal functions, or structs may change
//! release-to-release without major or minor version changes. Use
//! internal implementation details at your own risk.
//!
//! lexical-parse-float mainly exists as an implementation detail for
//! lexical-core, although its API is stable. If you would like to use
//! a high-level API that writes to and parses from `String` and `&str`,
//! respectively, please look at [lexical](https://crates.io/crates/lexical)
//! instead. If you would like an API that supports multiple numeric
//! conversions, please look at [lexical-core](https://crates.io/crates/lexical-core)
//! instead.
//!
//! # Version Support
//!
//! The minimum, standard, required version is 1.51.0, for const generic
//! support. Older versions of lexical support older Rust versions.
